# Transfer annotations from reference to genome assembly

## transferGTF
Can only read in GTF files. Needs reference multi-fasta, reference annotation and genome assembly. Requires Nucmer from the Mummer package, it can do alignment better than I ever can.

## To do:
* Rewrite in Perl(?)
* Support GFF and files with comments
* Customizable multi-thread
